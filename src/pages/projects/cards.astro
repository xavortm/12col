						This memory card game uses live announcements to help you play.
						When you enter the card grid, you'll hear its dimensions.
						Flipping a card announces its name, and matching pairs announces your score.
						Each match earns points times a multiplier. Matching pairs in a row
						grows your points and multiplies your multiplier. A wrong guess
						resets the multiplier to zero, but your points never go down.
						The number on each card shows how many points it gives,
						starting at 4 and dropping by one on each flip.
